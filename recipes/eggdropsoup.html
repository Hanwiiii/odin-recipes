<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Comforting savory bowl of egg drop soup with delicious chicken</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 chicken thighs</li>
        <li>4 tsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>Knob of ginger</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>2 cups frozen corn</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 green onion</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 tbsp water</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp white pepper</li>
        <li>1 tsp seasame oil</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the medium mixing bowl, mix chicken with 2 teaspoons soy sauce. Set aside and let marinate while preparing remaining ingredients.</li>
        <li>In a large dutch oven on medium high heat, add cooking oil and ginger. Cook the ginger for about a minute to infuse the oil with flavour. Push the ginger aside and add chicken and cook for 3-4 minutes on each side. Remove the chicken and cut into bite sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat down to low. Add garlic and cook for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Add chicken broth. Turn the heat up to medium. Scrape up all the brown bits and deglaze the bottom. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add corn and 2 teaspoons soy sauce. Once the soup is simmering, turn the heat down to low.</li>
        <li>In another small bowl, dissolve cornstarch in cold water to make a slurry. Stir the slurry into the soup. Add more slurry if a thicker soup is desired.</li>
        <li>While gently stirring the soup, slowly drizzle in the eggs to create the egg ribbons. Add chicken along with any drippings and green onion. Heat through.</li>
        <li>Remove the ginger. Stir in ground white pepper and drizzle with sesame oil.</li>
        <li>Serve</li>
    </ol>
